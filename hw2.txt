1 a. (((n+1)(n)/2) + n + 10) / (n+1)

1 b. (10 + (10 + ((n+1) * n) / 2))/(n + 1)

2. No this program will not always have the same output. The reason output varies is that
   what is outputted is based upon the pid a process is given at the fork. Sometimes the parent process will be given 0 at fork and other times the child process will be given 0. One of the two will always receive 0 and the other will recieve a nonzero value but which the scheduler assigns them varies.
